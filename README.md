# Data-driven optimal prediction with control

This repository contains the source code used in [our study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01991) on how to find the proper approximation of linear operator in the case of a dynamical system with control, where some variables are unobserved.
We consider two test nonlinear systems and separately the case of the unknown ground truth control operator.
